Super Bowl 2025 live streams are almost here, with the biggest event in the NFL calendar taking place today (Sunday, February 9). New Orleans is the host city for the clash between holders Kansas City Chiefs, the AFC champions, and Philadelphia Eagles, the kings of the NFC. It's a rematch of Super Bowl LVII, which the Chiefs won 38-35.

The Chiefs have a piece of history in their sights, as they attempt to become the first team to win three Super Bowls in a row. They went 15-2 in the regular season, with the Eagles boasting a 14-3 record in their conference.

The Chiefs are narrow favourites, but we cannot take anything for granted at Super Bowl 2025. The Eagles are strong against the run and their defensive and offensive stats are stronger. But with Patrick Mahomes at quarterback, the Chiefs will fancy their chances. Either way, this is set to be an epic encounter.

President Trump and Taylor Swift are due to attend and there's a Kendrick Lamar halftime show, but the focus will be on the quarterbacks and touchdowns.
